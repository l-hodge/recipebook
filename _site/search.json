Toss to combine, then arrange the aubergines skin side down. Roast for 30 minutes, until nicely golden and starting to catch in places.\nAdd all the remaining ingredients to the pan, apart from the Parmesan, along with a healthy amount of salt and pepper. Stir to combine, then bake for another 30 minutes, covered.\nGive everything a good stir and cook for a final 10-15 minutes, uncovered, until the sauce clings to the pasta. Serve with Parmesan and extra basil leaves sprinkled over.\n\nInspiration: Yotam Ottolenghi ‘Comfort’"
