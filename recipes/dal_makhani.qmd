## Method

-   Boil the lentils for 1 hour in the liquid from the tin and a little water.

-   Heat a large knob of butter in a saucepan, saute onion until translucent, then add most of the chilli (save a little for topping), garlic and ginger for a couple of minutes.

-   Add dry spices and fry until fragrant before adding the tomato paste and drained lentils.

-   Cover the lentils with water and bring to the boil. Then simmer on a low heat with the lid on for 2 hours. Check regularly that there is enough water and stir to prevent the dal sticking to the bottom of the pan.

-   Use a stick blender to break up some of the lentils, but leave some lentils intact. Finish with a splash of cream and another knob of butter.

-   Serve with rice of naan bread, coriander and the remainingÂ diced chilli.
